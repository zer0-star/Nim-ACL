# Contributing to Nim-ACL

This repository keeps compatibility with existing Nim-ACL / ACL-style APIs while adding small convenience facades, tests, and documentation.

## Local verification policy

Before pushing changes that touch library code, tests, or documentation, run:

~~~bash
bash tools/quick_verify.sh
~~~

The script runs the main smoke tests for:

- core ACL modules
- extra FPS facade
- monoid helpers
- graph template / graph algorithm helpers
- universal segtree
- generated documentation consistency

It writes the full log to:

~~~text
/tmp/nacl_quick_verify.log
~~~

and prints a short final result block:

~~~text
===== NACL RESULT START =====
STATUS: OK
...
===== NACL RESULT END =====
~~~

When sharing logs in issue comments or review threads, prefer sharing only this final `NACL RESULT` block unless the status is `NG`.

## Documentation policy

Documentation is generated from `document_ja/**/*.md` and `document_en/**/*.md`.

To regenerate docs, publish to `gh-pages`, and run a short live-page sanity check, run:

~~~bash
bash tools/publish_docs.sh
~~~

The script writes the full log to:

~~~text
/tmp/nacl_publish_docs.log
~~~

and prints a short final `NACL RESULT` block.

## CI policy

The `quick-verify` GitHub Actions workflow should call:

~~~bash
bash tools/quick_verify.sh
~~~

This keeps CI behavior aligned with the local smoke test.

In CI, `tools/quick_verify.sh` treats generated documentation diffs as non-strict by default. This avoids Linux/macOS documentation rendering drift from failing unrelated code checks. Documentation publication remains the responsibility of `tools/publish_docs.sh`. Set `NACL_STRICT_DOCS=1` to make CI fail on generated documentation diffs.

When adding a new facade or user-facing helper, prefer the following sequence:

1. Add or update implementation.
2. Add targeted tests.
3. Add or update Japanese documentation.
4. Run `bash tools/quick_verify.sh`.
5. Commit and push.
6. Run `bash tools/publish_docs.sh` when documentation changed.

## Generated binaries

Local Nim test runs may generate executable files next to test files and may also create `.nim_runtime/` or `nimcache/`. Verification scripts remove the known generated test artifacts automatically. Do not commit generated binaries or generated runtime directories.

## Warning policy

Nim/C++ backend warnings such as generated-array-bound warnings may appear during local test builds. Treat them as warnings unless the test command fails. A successful run must still end with `STATUS: OK` in the `NACL RESULT` block.

## Documentation policy for advanced algorithms

For advanced or less common algorithms, documentation should be usable as both
an API reference and a short learning note.

Prefer the following structure:

1. Overview: what problem the algorithm solves.
2. Use cases: common contest patterns and representative problems.
3. Idea: the core invariant or greedy/DP/graph principle.
4. API reference: import, types, constructors, operations.
5. Nim-friendly usage: operators, iterators, templates, or macros when helpful.
6. Complexity and pitfalls.
7. Related resources and libraries.

Do not copy implementations from other languages into the documentation.
When other public competitive-programming libraries are useful references, link
to them instead.

## Nim documentation syntax highlighting

Generated documentation uses Nim's official
`packages/docutils/highlite` tokenizer.

Use a normal Nim fence for API definitions and short fragments:

~~~markdown
~~~nim
proc prod(tree: SqrtTree, l, r: int): T
~~~
~~~

Substantial usage examples should display line numbers. Place this marker
immediately before the Nim code block:

~~~markdown
<!-- nim-line-numbers -->
~~~nim
import atcoder/extra/structure/sqrt_tree

proc add(a, b: int): int = a + b

let tree = initSqrtTree(@[1, 2, 3], 0, add)
doAssert tree.prod(0, 3) == 6
~~~
~~~

The marker utility automatically adds the marker to substantial Nim blocks
under headings such as `使用例`, `実行例`, `Example`, and `Usage`:

~~~bash
python3 tools/mark_complete_nim_examples.py
~~~

To suppress automatic line numbering in an example section, place:

~~~html
<!-- nim-no-line-numbers -->
~~~

Line numbers are rendered with CSS counters and are not part of the copied
source text. Syntax highlighting and line numbers do not depend on a CDN or
browser-side JavaScript.

## Documentation link policy

Entries under `関連資料`, `Related resources`, `References`, and similar
sections should use concrete links rather than plain resource names.

- Internal Nim-ACL documentation uses relative links and opens in the same tab.
- External HTTP/HTTPS links open in a new tab.
- Generated external links include `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`.
- `noreferrer` is not added by default, so ordinary referral information is
  preserved.
- Prefer official documentation, original papers, official problem pages,
  and primary project repositories.
- Do not reproduce substantial external text, figures, or source code merely
  to avoid linking to the original source.

Run the related-resource linker and audit with:

~~~bash
python3 tools/link_related_resources.py
python3 tools/link_related_resources.py --audit-only
python3 tools/postprocess_document_links.py
python3 tools/audit_generated_document_html.py
~~~
