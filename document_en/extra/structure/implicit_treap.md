# Implicit Treap

Maintains a dynamic sequence with an implicit Treap whose balancing priorities
are randomized.

It supports insertion and erasure by position, element access and replacement,
range reversal, and range products.

## General form

~~~nim
proc op(
    left,
    right: S,
): S =
  ...

proc e(): S =
  ...

type
  Treap =
    ImplicitTreapType[S](
      op,
      e,
    )

var tree =
  Treap.init(
    values,
  )
~~~

An empty tree can be initialized as follows.

~~~nim
var tree =
  Treap.init()
~~~

## Parameters and types

- `S`: element and aggregate type
- `op(left, right)`: Monoid operation
- `e()`: Monoid identity
- `values`: initial sequence
- `seed`: 64-bit seed used to generate node priorities

`op` must be associative, and `e()` must be both a left and right identity.
Commutativity is not required.

The default seed is `DefaultImplicitTreapSeed`. It is fixed, so the same
operation sequence creates a reproducible tree. The seed affects only the tree
shape and running time; it does not affect returned values or correctness.

When an initial sequence is supplied, node storage is preallocated for its
length. Storage belonging to erased nodes is reused by later insertions.

## Preconditions

Let `n = tree.len`.

- `insert(position, value)`: `0 <= position <= n`
- `erase(position)`, `get(position)`, `set(position, value)`, and
  `tree[position]`: `0 <= position < n`
- `reverse(left, right)` and `prod(left, right)`:
  `0 <= left <= right <= n`

A violation raises `ValueError`.

## Return values and side effects

- `tree.len`: current length
- `tree.insert(position, value)`: inserts immediately before `position`
- `tree.erase(position)`: erases and returns one value
- `tree.get(position)`, `tree[position]`: returns one value
- `tree.set(position, value)`, `tree[position] = value`: replaces one value
- `tree.reverse(left, right)`: reverses the half-open range `[left, right)`
- `tree.prod(left, right)`: returns the product of `[left, right)`
- `tree.allProd()`: returns the product of the entire sequence
- `tree.toSeq()`: returns the current sequence as `seq[S]`

`prod` on an empty range returns `e()`.

Every subtree stores both its forward and backward aggregate. Therefore range
reversal works for noncommutative Monoids without an extra callback for
reversing an aggregate.

## Example

~~~nim
import atcoder/extra/structure/implicit_treap

proc op(
    left,
    right: int,
): int =
  left + right

proc e(): int =
  0

type
  SumTreap =
    ImplicitTreapType[int](
      op,
      e,
    )

var tree =
  SumTreap.init(
    @[1, 2, 3, 4]
  )

tree.insert(
  2,
  10,
)

doAssert tree.toSeq() ==
  @[1, 2, 10, 3, 4]

tree.reverse(
  1,
  4,
)

doAssert tree.toSeq() ==
  @[1, 3, 10, 2, 4]

doAssert tree.prod(
  1,
  4,
) == 15
~~~

## Related APIs

- `SplayTree`: dynamic sequences based on a self-adjusting tree, including
  Lazy Action variants and Link-Cut Tree infrastructure
- `PersistentSegTree`: persistent versions of a segment tree
- `LazySegTree`: range updates and products on a fixed-length sequence

This Implicit Treap is an owning container. Internal nodes and the root are not
exposed; split and merge are implementation details.

The first public version supports reversal and Monoid products, but does not
include Lazy Actions.

## Complexity and implementation

Let `n` be the current length.

Expected complexity:

- `insert`, `erase`, `get`, `set`: `O(log n)`
- `reverse`, `prod`: `O(log n)`
- `allProd`, `len`: `O(1)`
- `toSeq`: `O(n)`
- construction from `n` initial values: `O(n log n)`

The worst case is `O(n)` when the randomized tree becomes highly unbalanced.

Memory usage is `O(n)`. Erased node slots are reused through a free list.
